Transfer designs from layout to browser.

Greetings!

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the HTML coder position within @WePlay! Esports company.

With over two yearâ€™s experience of front-end development, I feel I would be a perfect match for your vacancy.

I am a frontend developer who has a wide range of front end skills. I have implemented many beautiful and effective designs. I enjoy writing optimised, cross-browser, most device compatible websites with excellent interactions and nice animations.

At the moment I`m a freelancer who wants back to the office and becomes a part of a team.

Thank you kindly for taking the time to review my application. If you require any further information, feel free to contact me. In any event, I look forward to hearing from you as the recruitment process progresses.
